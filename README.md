# Technical Challenge

Welcome to the PlannerPal technical challenge. This is designed to give you an opportunity to showcase how you think and the kind of code you produce.

## How It Works

This repo contains two directories:

- **`client/`** — A React + TypeScript application
- **`server/`** — A Node/Express + TypeScript application

You can choose to complete **either** the front-end challenge or the back-end challenge — it doesn't matter which one you pick. Go with whichever you feel most comfortable with.

## Time Expectation

Please don't spend more than **2 hours** on this challenge. We're not looking for a fully polished, production-ready application. What matters to us is:

- How you approach the problem
- How you structure your code
- The decisions you make and why

It's absolutely fine if you don't finish everything. If there are things you would have done given more time, feel free to make a note of them.

## Submitting Your Work

When you're done, you can either:

1. **Clone this repo to your personal GitHub** and share the link with us, or
2. **Zip it up and send it over** — just make sure to delete the `node_modules` folders from both `client/` and `server/` before zipping.

## Getting Started

### Client

```bash
cd client
npm install
npm run dev
```

### Server

```bash
cd server
npm install
npm run dev
```
